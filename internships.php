				<h1><a href="https://www.forbin.com/">VGM Forbin</a> </h1>
				<p>At VGM Forbin, I was a Web Programmer dealing with VPanel, Forbin's proprietary CMS. I gained a lot of knowledge on how CMS' work in general and how to handle different problems. I learned how to properly structure a project, from the simple folder structure to how to properly program the project so that it is scalable for the future. I mainly worked in PHP back-end, with a little front-end work as needed from programmers.</p><br>

				<h1><a href="http://www.huntercreativegroup.com/">Hunter Creative Group</a> </h1>
				<p>At Hunter Creative Group I was mostly dealing with front-end development. I was tasked with recreating, with the new HTML5 standards, websites that were out of date and not mobile friendly. This internship has served me well in the web development area because I got experience with mobile design and cross-browser support for Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safarie and Opera. I have worked with WordPress here as well, getting experience on how they programmed their CMS to work. I had to take a website and recreate it in WordPress to make a theme.</p><br>
